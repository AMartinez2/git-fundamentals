# Lab

The best way of ramping up on Git is to use it. This lab is to provide a
simulation of working on a remote Git host. You will be likely to work on some
problems people have solved, but this will be part of the learning experience. 

### Procedures
- Fork this repository by clicking the fork button on the top right
- Edit the markdown file `problem_name.md` using your favorite text editor
- Answer the questions by changing `[ ]` => `[x]`
  (There are at least one correct choice)
- Add explanation
- Issue a pull request once you have the solution

### Note
The questions can be tricky.

There are many ways to contribute
- Ask questions for clarification (open new issues)
- Improve existing questions or explanations
- Make new questions

Good luck. Have fun!
