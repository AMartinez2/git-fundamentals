    \begin{flushleft}

related to a project, including documents, visualizations, and data.
    \end{flushleft}
    \item Publish your changes
    \begin{flushleft}
You initialize it in a directory, and then tell it when you want your changes
to be permanent.
    \end{flushleft}
    \item Travel in time
    \begin{flushleft}
You can go back to a previous iteration at any time, and can see exactly what
has changed between versions.
